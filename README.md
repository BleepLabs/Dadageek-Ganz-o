"Relaxation" device example for Dadageek </br>

Here's a device I put together as an example for my classes at Dadageek. </br>
It's kind of a relaxation device that slowly changes color while lightning flashes and static swells. The rate is changed when it's touched.</br>

This was a quick project to show what can be done with just a few components and some code.</br>
More info on the class here. </br>

The screen is made thick piece of acrylic that's been CNCd with a simple pattern I made in blender. A teensy using its audio.h library is doing all the work.</br>
